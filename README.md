# Project Summary

In this repo, you'll find the code files needed to create a simple ChatGPT plugin that retrieves information for a single stock.
- **main.py**: A simple Flask program written to retrieve stock informatiom from an external API (Alpha Vantage)
- **ai-plugin.json**: The plugin manifest file that contains plugin metadata (name, logo, etc.) and auth type
- **openapi.yaml**: The OpenAPI specification with details about your API so ChatGPT understands what it does

For a step-by-step walk-through of how to set up a development environment and install the plugin in ChatGPT, check out this [Pluralsight blog]([**URL TO PLURALSIGHT BLOG**]).
